<h3 center> My Reviews-Descriptive list</h3>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Movie:</strong>Substance</dt>
<dd>This story depicts a recent growing trend of an unhealthy obsession with anti-aging,as we know old is gold but it doesn't seem to apply for today's generation.We see a fitness instructor getting replaced by someone younger just because people don't prefer seeing someone older.It also highlights how easily one can be replaced as soon as their demand in the market reduces</dd>
<dt><strong>TV Show:</strong>Hi Bye Mama!</dt>
<dd>This tv series talks about how a mother passes away but her soul can be seen by the child and how she cherishes her daughter while the daughter bonds with her new mother.It shows the child growing and the challenges the new mother faces as she has to quit her job to take care of the child.It is a very heartwarming story</dd>
<dt><strong>Book:</strong>Atomic Habits</dt>
<dd>This is a book which i would suggest to anybody who wishes to start reading but doesn't know how to start,or from where to start.This book shows how small habits help you achieve a more organised future,and how things cannot change within a small time frame and that one should patiently wait and be consistent with their efforts.</dd>
